Just a short note on running jupyter's notebook in vscode and leverage github copilot's code generation features.

I am not a data scientist but I wanted to write some code snippets in python
and I find that doing it in jupyter's notebook is very convenient. Its interactive interface is the main reason which alows to "play" with the code and execute different code segments easily.

I wanted to leverage copilot's code generation and code suggestions so I decided to work inside vscode with the Jupyter extension installed.
Maybe not surprisignly, copilot generates or suggests code when detecting python code in the notebook's cell.

Tools:

1. visual code editor
2. Python extension
3. Jupyter extension
4. Github Copilot extension (including a subscription)

note: Eventually, I recommended to pay a few dollars a month for github's copilot subscription to be able to use it continously and effectively.
